# Little Strings

Little Strings is a small business located in Leicester that teaches children and young adults how to play the guitar.

I have used markdown format for the headers and bullets, links and tables on this readme, but found the img element to be more useful when controlling picture sizes on this document.

## UX

### Project Goal

To engage children and young people with music, showing them how easy it is to learn and fun it is to play.

#### Student Goals

Most children will see this web application being used by parents, or from curiosity will have searched google for it themselves. Either way, they will likely be bored by information in writing and lose interest if things aren't colourful and exciting. The more excited they become about the application, the more likely they are to ask their parents about it, if they don't already know of it.

It would be too easy to create a product entirely for children but if young teenagers approach it they will be put off by things too chldish looking.

- Learn how to play guitar
- Have fun

#### Parent Goals

Parents most importantly need to know their children will be safe in this environment. They also need some knowledge of what their children will learn, and to know the benefits for their child.

- To place my child in a safe learning environment
- To feel at ease with my choice of tutor

#### Developer and Business Goals

Many young children are lost in YouTube and TikTok videos and many parents struggle to find affordable childcare when life means they have to work long hours of the day. This is where Little Strings comes in.

Little Strings is passionate about using that valuable time kids aren't in school or with their parents, to show them that learning is still important away from those environments, and can be really fun.

So many young people aren't sure what they want to be when they grow up or where they want to go. By learning simple chords kids can play along to their favourite songs and it's a skill that they can take with them in life to either perform, teach or work in in other ways in their future.

Kids need to be able to see the benefits of learning, and how it can open doors for them.

- To attract the attention of young people and children
- To teach wherever possible on the web application
- To reassure parents that their children are in a safe, learning environment
- To teach users basic music knowledge like chord shapes

### User Stories

As a child, I want to see:
- Bright colours
- A game to interact with
- Simple imagery, not too busy, basic shapes
- Appropriate content, no improper language usage or slang
- No complicated sentences

I want to:
- Click and play
- Learn instruments

So that:
- I have fun
- I can play my favourite songs

For Teens

- Information as to why music could be good to learn
- One-to-one session availability, so they know that no kids will be running around on their session and escape from parents
- The bright colours and game will interact with their younger side
- To learn guitar, this is a cool thing to teens

As a parent I want to see:
- Interactive learning on the app
- Basic music knowledge on screen
- A child-friendly webpage

I want:
- To be able to contact with questions and worries
- Safety information
- Information on lessons taught
- Site and parking information
- Professionalism
- To know the benefits of learning guitar
- Checks done on tutors

So that:
- I can rest knowing my children are safe
- I know my childs time is being used optimally

### Design Choices

The overall experience needs to be fun, colourful and exciting. I have looked at the following sites for inspiration:

[Fun Bain](https://www.funbrain.com/)

[The Kidz Page](http://thekidzpage.com/)

[Starfall](https://www.starfall.com/h/)

[National Geographic](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/)

[PBS Kids](https://pbskids.org/)

[Coolmath.com](https://www.coolmath.com/)

From these I can see a consistency in colours, using greens, yellows and blues. Bright solid colours are often used on backgrounds.
I can also see fun, large smooth bubble letters in the fonts used.
Some of these sites even have audio to grab the kids attention.

### Q and A of Potential Users

I spoke to three different potential users regarding the website. I showed them what I had made and asked them the following questions:

#### Q1 What makes a good website experience?
REVIEW QUESTIONS

### Competitor Review

Who else is there local to Leicester that has similar goals? Well, I found a few guitar teachers, but none near Leicester aimed specifically towards younger people. Here are three examples.

[John Joslin](https://johnjoslinguitarlessonsleicester.com/)

Pros:

- Looks professional through it's use of colours, not a lot of colour, but stylish greys.
- Excellent reviews section.
- Background images relevant and works well.

Cons:

- Wix.com bar along the top makes it look amateur.
- The word "Teacher" is written at the top left and this is clearly an error of some sort.
- All of the information is on one page. The navigation doesn't take you to another page, so if you are on a section, you have to scroll to get back to where you were apart from one button at the very bottom which says back to top.


[Your Guitar Academy](https://yourguitaracademy.com/guitar-lessons-locations/leicester/)

Cons:

- Couldn't even access the site because of a message that says fully booked, which you can't get past unless you enter details. If you haven't engaged the audience, why would they sign up to you?
- Whether they are booked or not, the site should still attempt to show content of some sort. At the very least the fully booked box should have a close tab.

[Intasound](https://www.intasound-music.co.uk/our-services/music-lessons/guitar-lessons/)

Pros:

- The page boasts an extensive list of tutors.

Cons:

- Like looking at a Wikipedia page. All text and space, not much colour or imagery.
- Looks boring, not very artistic.
- Only has basic information about tutors. Some have email links, some don't.

Contacts could've had clickable divs with an image on the front to help sell the tutor.

### Roadmap

This roadmap indicates the importance and viability of specific opportunities.
EXAMPLE
<!--
| Opportunities/Problems      | Importance | Viability   |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Teach users how to stop a panic attack      | 5       | 4
| Encourage them to sign uo to newsletter   | 4        | 5
| Encourage them to interact with classes   | 5        | 4
| Showcase images from classes   | 1        | 1
| Show them positive feedback from other users   | 4        | 1

As mentioned before, the stories page isn't necessary just yet as we don't have previous users feedback to use yet. So that and images from classes aren't necessary yet.-->

### Fixed Bugs

This is a detailed log of the issues I ran into whilst coding my first project, and how I overcame them.

My header and footer elements were relatively straight forward to put together. I looked at my first project and how I had gotten the list to display in a line with no decoration rather than top to bottom with bullet points and underlining. I also found that using bootstrap to divide the logo and navbar links into 5|7 rather than 4|8 or 6|6 gave the page more of a centered feel due to the width of both items.

1). The first issue I found was trying to create the grid layout on my homepage. I spent a while changing classes and moving elements only to realise I'd forgotten to identify the classes as grid areas in css. I then noticed when this still didn't work, that my closing div tag of the homepage-one div was inline with the opening tag, rather than after the content. Fixing this corrected the issue.

### Unfixed Bugs

There are no bugs unfixed to my knowledge.
