<!--ABOUT-->

I have used markdown format for the headers and bullets, links and tables on this readme, but found the img element to be more useful when controlling picture sizes on this document.

### User Stories

Example

<!--As someone who struggles with anxiety, I want:
- Calming, spacious UX that isn't cluttered and therefore stressful
- Peace inducing colours to subconsciously add to the sites serenity.
- To learn a bit about why I feel the way I feel and how to get better
- To know where my classes are and how to get there, so I feel safe

As someone who struggles with depression, I want:
- To know that I'm not alone, through images and tutor information
- To be ensured that people gain happiness from the classes
- Something that regularly makes me feel good as opposed to a one-time fix, something that stays with me for longer

As a relative or friend of someone who struggles, I want:
- To know where classes are and what times they are
- To know that my friend/relative is going to have an educational but fun experience
- To learn a bit myself so I can be of better help to my friend/relative-->

### Q and A of Potential Users

I spoke to three different potential users regarding the website. I showed them what I had made and asked them the following questions:

#### Q1 What makes a good website experience?
REVIEW QUESTIONS

<!--
Person with Depression:

Person with Anxiety:

- "Familiarity within groups on social media sites. To be able to click on a link and find the information you need easily."

Person with relative/friend of someone who struggles:

- "A good website experience for someone not tech savvy like me is something self explanatory and easy to navigate, it's being able to know where a link is and what it does."

Person with Anxiety:

- "Group activities that can be experienced online as well as in person if I am unable to leave the house."

Person with Anxiety:

Person with relative/friend of someone who struggles:

- "A change to make to the website would be maybe including an alternative display option for example a dark screen alternative for people with colour blindness or an Audio Description choice for visually impared so that when you hover over an icon it says out loud what you are about to click."-->

### Roadmap

This roadmap indicates the importance and viability of specific opportunities.
EXAMPLE
<!--
| Opportunities/Problems      | Importance | Viability   |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Teach users how to stop a panic attack      | 5       | 4
| Encourage them to sign uo to newsletter   | 4        | 5
| Encourage them to interact with classes   | 5        | 4
| Showcase images from classes   | 1        | 1
| Show them positive feedback from other users   | 4        | 1

As mentioned before, the stories page isn't necessary just yet as we don't have previous users feedback to use yet. So that and images from classes aren't necessary yet.-->

## Deployment
<!--
THIS MAY HAVE TO BE THE SAME?!

This project was developed using Gitpod, committed to git and pushed using the built in function within Gitpod.

To deploy this page, I followed the following steps.

1. Log into GitHub.

2. Select project-one-relieve from list of repositories.

3. From the top menu items, select settings.

4. Select Pages from the left hand side menu.

5. Under Source click the drop-down menu labelled None and select main.

6. On selecting main the page is automatically refreshed, the website is now deployed.

7. Scroll back down to the GitHub Pages section to retrieve the link to the deployed website.

At the time of submitting this project, the Development Branch and Master Branch were identical.

To clone you will need

1. A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

2. The [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/) browser.

Then follow the following steps:

1. Install the Gitpod Browser Extension for Chrome.

2. After installation, restart the browser.

3. Log into Gitpod with your account.

4. Navigate to the Project GitHub repository.

5. Click the green Gitpod button in the top right corner of the repository.

6. A new Gitpod workplace will created from the code in github where you can work locally.

To work on the project code within a local IDE such as VSCode, Python, etc.

1. Follow [this link](https://github.com/ryanmcnally93/project-one-relieve) to the Project GitHub repository.

2. Under the repository name, click "Clone the download".

3. In the clone with HTTPs section, copy the clone URL for the repository.

The site had no broken links, but the images wouldn't show initially. I had to change the style.css background URL's to include "/project-one-relieve/" and after that they worked correctly.-->
