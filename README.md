# Little Strings

Little Strings is a small business located in Leicester that teaches children and young adults how to play the guitar.

I have used markdown format for the headers and bullets, links and tables on this readme, but found the img element to be more useful when controlling picture sizes on this document.

## UX

### Project Goal

To engage children and young people with music, showing them how easy it is to learn and fun it is to play.

#### Student Goals

Most children will see this web application being used by parents, or from curiosity will have searched google for it themselves. Either way, they will likely be bored by information in writing and lose interest if things aren't colourful and exciting. The more excited they become about the application, the more likely they are to ask their parents about it, if they don't already know of it.

It would be too easy to create a product entirely for children but if young teenagers approach it they will be put off by things too chldish looking.

- Learn how to play guitar
- Have fun

#### Parent Goals

Parents most importantly need to know their children will be safe in this environment. They also need some knowledge of what their children will learn, and to know the benefits for their child.

- To place my child in a safe learning environment
- To feel at ease with my choice of tutor

#### Developer and Business Goals

Many young children are lost in YouTube and TikTok videos and many parents struggle to find affordable childcare when life means they have to work long hours of the day. This is where Little Strings comes in.

Little Strings is passionate about using that valuable time kids aren't in school or with their parents, to show them that learning is still important away from those environments, and can be really fun.

So many young people aren't sure what they want to be when they grow up or where they want to go. By learning simple chords kids can play along to their favourite songs and it's a skill that they can take with them in life to either perform, teach or work in in other ways in their future.

Kids need to be able to see the benefits of learning, and how it can open doors for them.

- To attract the attention of young people and children
- To teach wherever possible on the web application
- To reassure parents that their children are in a safe, learning environment
- To teach users basic music knowledge like chord shapes

### User Stories

As a child, I want to see:
- Bright colours
- A game to interact with
- Simple imagery, not too busy, basic shapes
- Appropriate content, no improper language usage or slang
- No complicated sentences

I want to:
- Click and play
- Learn instruments

So that:
- I have fun
- I can play my favourite songs

For Teens

- Information as to why music could be good to learn
- One-to-one session availability, so they know that no kids will be running around on their session and escape from parents
- The bright colours and game will interact with their younger side
- To learn guitar, this is a cool thing to teens

As a parent I want to see:
- Interactive learning on the app
- Basic music knowledge on screen
- A child-friendly webpage

I want:
- To be able to contact with questions and worries
- Safety information
- Information on lessons taught
- Site and parking information
- Professionalism
- To know the benefits of learning guitar
- Checks done on tutors

So that:
- I can rest knowing my children are safe
- I know my childs time is being used optimally

### Design Choices

The overall experience needs to be fun, colourful and exciting. I have looked at the following sites for inspiration:

[Fun Bain](https://www.funbrain.com/)

[The Kidz Page](http://thekidzpage.com/)

[Starfall](https://www.starfall.com/h/)

[National Geographic](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/)

[PBS Kids](https://pbskids.org/)

[Coolmath.com](https://www.coolmath.com/)

From these I can see a consistency in colours, using greens, yellows and blues. Bright solid colours are often used on backgrounds.
I can also see fun, large smooth bubble letters in the fonts used.
Some of these sites even have audio to grab the kids attention.

#### Fonts

- When I put together my project in Balsamiq Wireframes, I was instantly very fond of the default font Balsamiq Sans. It looks like a playful, child-friendly text and goes well with the web application.

#### Icons

- Description

#### Colours

- Throughout the sites I looked at, I noticed primary colours being used in spaces that would normally be off-white. Any space deemed "boring" by kids but professional by adults is filled with exciting imagery and colours, and my web application is no exception!
- I have chosen green and yellow to grab kids attention, as well as darker greens on the yellow for text and borders, which change when you hover over them.

### Competitor Review

Who else is there local to Leicester that has similar goals? Well, I found a few guitar teachers, but none near Leicester aimed specifically towards younger people. Here are three examples.

[John Joslin](https://johnjoslinguitarlessonsleicester.com/)

Pros:

- Looks professional through it's use of colours, not a lot of colour, but stylish greys.
- Excellent reviews section.
- Background images relevant and works well.

Cons:

- Wix.com bar along the top makes it look amateur.
- The word "Teacher" is written at the top left and this is clearly an error of some sort.
- All of the information is on one page. The navigation doesn't take you to another page, so if you are on a section, you have to scroll to get back to where you were apart from one button at the very bottom which says back to top.


[Your Guitar Academy](https://yourguitaracademy.com/guitar-lessons-locations/leicester/)

Cons:

- Couldn't even access the site because of a message that says fully booked, which you can't get past unless you enter details. If you haven't engaged the audience, why would they sign up to you?
- Whether they are booked or not, the site should still attempt to show content of some sort. At the very least the fully booked box should have a close tab.

[Intasound](https://www.intasound-music.co.uk/our-services/music-lessons/guitar-lessons/)

Pros:

- The page boasts an extensive list of tutors.

Cons:

- Like looking at a Wikipedia page. All text and space, not much colour or imagery.
- Looks boring, not very artistic.
- Only has basic information about tutors. Some have email links, some don't.

Contacts could've had clickable divs with an image on the front to help sell the tutor.

### Fixed Bugs

This is a detailed log of the issues I ran into whilst coding my first project, and how I overcame them.

My header and footer elements were relatively straight forward to put together. I looked at my first project and how I had gotten the list to display in a line with no decoration rather than top to bottom with bullet points and underlining. I also found that using bootstrap to divide the logo and navbar links into 5|7 rather than 4|8 or 6|6 gave the page more of a centered feel due to the width of both items.

1). The first issue I found was trying to create the grid layout on my homepage. I spent a while changing classes and moving elements only to realise I'd forgotten to identify the classes as grid areas in css. I then noticed when this still didn't work, that my closing div tag of the homepage-one div was inline with the opening tag, rather than after the content. Fixing this corrected the issue.

IMAGES.

2). The next thing I noticed was that my lessons navbar styling was appearing different than my other pages, even though it had the same code. This is because I've been using bootstrap on my navbar, and have inherited some of its properties. This was only proving to be an issue on my lessons page because in order to get my carousel working, I had to paste a different version of bootstrap into my html's head element. I used dev tools to identify the different styling that was effecting my lessons navbar and corrected the issue that way.

IMAGES.

3). A bit issue I had with coding the guitar game, came when I tried to use push and splice on an array in JavaScript. Every google fix was the same, make sure you're using the function on an array! I was indeed using the functions on an array, but when I tested the code, I had a fail saying that the push and splice functions didn't exist. I used console.log to try and figure out what was wrong, but it confirmed that I was definitely testing an array.

In the end I used the help of a tutor to get to the bottom of the issue, which wasn't my code, but the test itself. The test was using the beforeall function to set the array, which was only containing one piece of data, and I had it set to a string. By setting the array to a string in the test, the test was failing. I changed this to an array, and actually realised later on that this array would only ever hold one piece of data, and so a string was the right way to go about it in the end. I got rid of the push and splice functions and used the equals sign instead.

IMAGES

4). During the game sequence, I needed to take my chord image div, and change it. To do so I had to take away the previous class added and add a new one, which proved to be particularly difficult. I used console.log before and after the function so I could see step by step what my code was doing and managed to fix the issue using an if statement. The statement checks the value of new class added, and gets rid of any other potential chord classes, making sure that only the correct chord class is in effect.

The site had no broken links, but the images wouldn't show initially. I had to change the style.css background URL's to include "/project-one-relieve/" and after that they worked correctly.-->

## Credits 

### Content 

- The code I used for the accordion, I got from [W3S.](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp) I used their template and added my own questions and answers.

- The carousel code was also found on [W3S.](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_carousel.asp) This code uses bootstrap classes to achieve the carousel. I decided to create the divs inside the carousel to split it in half, with information as well as pictures, but the code that makes it work is from bootstrap.

- Whenever I needed to crop an image quickly, I used [iloveimg.](https://www.iloveimg.com/crop-image)

Overflow: hidden helped when setting my grid on guitar game, means things can overlap so speech bubble can overlap larry
struggled with concept of columns and rows and realised i had wrong calling - speech instead of larrys speech
margin left was pushing page on smaller screens, needed percentage instead
lowerAnswer = userAnswer.toLowerCase(); fixed the issue of capital letters not being accepted
used the for loop to iterate through the three correct and wrong answers and make sure the correct message is being shown, rather than use the long-winded way used earlier.
blue border after click, because of :focus outline, set to 0 and give rgb property
accordion https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp
ccsChange // I have used a longer if statement ass opposed to a for loop due to the fact that there are two important classes that I don't want removed.
    // I could still have used a for loop but would probably have been as complicated as this is, and I wanted to show I could achieve the same result
    // in two different ways.
Two tests not working for containing variables in correct and wrong answer arrays. I have screenshot for this one.

I had to create two more states in the object game, old message, and new message.
I used strings rather than variables in the correct and wrong choices arrays, defining what they were in the functions instead.
I then created the random message generators, one for wrong, one for right, and two check functions to see if the results obtained were the same as before.
Now, whenever a message is returned that is the same as before, the generator is run again, meaning that the same message does not appear twice in a row.
There may well be a much less exhausting way to do this! But this is the way that I fixed the issue.

I had an issue where the accordion just flash showed the result. I added the jquery script to my grown ups page and changed the javascript originally written by W3Schools, adding the jquery code so that they slide up and down instead.

On the lessons page, the guitar logo changed colour only when hovered on the very bottom of it. The only difference betweem this and other pages was the bootstrap callings being made to make the carousel work. I tried to place the bootstrap link that I am using on the other pages last, and this worked, however, it changed the carousel indicators. My guess is this css version doesn't support whatever styling was being used on the indicators, so I styled them myself. Now the guitar hover works, and the indicators are better than before, as their colour matches that of the rest of the application.

Lessons navbar displaying differently, because of all the bootstrap differences. I added some styling to parts of the navbar (padding right and left on navbardropdown to 0, padding-top 5% to list items, height declarations to stop there being differences on different pages).

Tomislav_5P Helped with issue regarding the keys not updating the text underneath on lessons page. adding the change event listener solved this issue.

Guitars either side of the form were absolute, which worked fine but when the accordions were clicked, and the form pushed down, the guitars stayed where they were, ruining the layout. I wanted the guitars to not appear above and below the titles, but rather be at the side of them, so I decided to put the titles inside the form, which had width: 33%, meaning the guitars could be position: relative and would move with the accordions.
